IMPROVEMENT: 
Is it possible to use the stopcast settings so if your healing a dsp/healer 
and a tank is under your oh shit level for cr to stop casting on 
lesser target to heal tank or in the case im referring to a target with debuff?

Wulf any planned support of the Malkorok healing mechanics, and Thok stopcasting at screeches? Also I don't see a donate buttons, is this by coincidence?

FIX: So you start encounter, healing wave crits for 140k then you do 60k healing waves normally 
it will always take that 140k.. So when the tank is 35% it thinks it can use a cheep HW to cover the deficit

IMPROVEMENT: Sacred Shield  support. (may not support this as traditionally this is a Prot Paladin talent.)

List of DoTs to shield players no matter HP
Smite Clipping

a dps toggle would be nice as well, a hot key of some kind

Holy Priest: its not casting lightspring,
Fix: Lightwell Lightspring placement

Improvement: Mass Dispel

Communicate to the user that 0 in both HP and Count on cooldowns and AoE spells will disable the use.

Improvement: LoS checks with StyxWoW.LastRedErrorMessage !!


Dynamic Priority Spell Logging
======================================

[{0} : {5}] [Deficit {1}%] [MPS: {2}] [HPS: {3}] [Oracle prio: {4}] {6}


0 = Spellname

1 = Deficit percent 
    (totalHeal - healthDeficit)
    * totalHeal is from one of two places.
      * - Calculated by Oracle (using current auras and current spellpower)
      * - Combat Log (it gets the minimum and Maximum the heal hit for and averages it, crits included)
    * healthDeficit is maxhealth - currentHealth of the healtarget (this usese predicted heal and includes your heals)

2 = Mana Per Second 
    * ManaCost / Math.Max(CastTime, 1)
	* - Used to weight the spell (the lower the MPS the higher the priority)
	* - Can be seen in the HealCalcs tab
	
3 = Heals per second   
    * TotalCalculatedHeal / Math.Max(CastTime, 1)
	* - Used to weight the spell (the higher the HPS the higher the priority ONLY valid when the Healtarget is less than Urgent Health percent)
	* - When the target is less than Urgent Health percent setting HPS get the priority. MPS is ignored
	* - Can be seen in the HealCalcs tab

4 = Oracle prio 
    * 100 - Deficit percent + (Oracles calulated heal / Mana Per Second) or (Heals per second)
    * this is the priority Oracle uses to order the spells.

5 = Oracles Calculated Heal
      * totalHeal is from one of two places.
      * - Calculated by Oracle (using current auras and current spellpower)
      * - Combat Log (it gets the minimum and Maximum the heal hit for and averages it, crits included)

6 = [Calculated Heal] or [Combat Log Heal (Averaged)]
      * If the heal came from the averaged combat log heal then [Combat Log Heal (Averaged)] will be shown
      * Once Oracle has the combat log value it will continue to use that value for the duration of the encounter.
      * If the combat log heal is greater than the current heal amount it will be updated.
      * if its a spell that was calculated by Oracle it will show [Calculated Heal]
