Paralytic Poison Shiv redesigned logic:
If unit is Range DPS/ Healer: They must be the rogue current target and not snared
If unit is Melee: They can be the rogue current target or is within rogue Shiv range. If his target is a Range/DPS, always Shiv if he's not rooted. If his target is Melee, only Shiv if his target HP < his HP and his target trying to run away from him.
