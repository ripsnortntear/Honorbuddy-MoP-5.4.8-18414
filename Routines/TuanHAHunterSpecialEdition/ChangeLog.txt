Add 4 crucial option for PvP

- Interrupt Any Offensive Spell: Interrupt ANY offensive cast

- Interrupt Only Important Offensive Spell: Interrupt ONLY important offensive cast
	- Always interrupt these spells
		"Cyclone",
		"Polymorph",
		"Ring of Frost",
		"Repentance",
		"Turn Evil",
		"Mind Control",
		"Mass Dispel",
		"Hex",
		"Fear",
		"Mind Flay (Insanity)",
		"Chaos Bolt",
		"Haunt",

	- Always interrupt these spells IF his target below 70%
		"Frostbolt",
		"Pyroblast",
		"Arcane Blast",
		"Mind Blast",
		"Mind Spike",
		"Lava Burst",
		"Elemental Blast",
		"Incinerate",
		"Drain Soul",
		"Malefic Grasp",

- Interrupt Healing Spells if My Target Below: Interrupt ANY healing cast if target below [defined percent] - this mostly serve for high end arena purpose. You don't want to waste a Silencing/Counter shot on a heal from enemy if your target above 70%

- Blanket CC/Silence Healer if My Target Below: Silence CC healer if target below [defined percent]
	This is a VERY NICE feature. When your target below 30% (you can change) your hunter will auto Scatter Shot, Pet Stun, Root, Sleep, Trap enemy healer so he can do nothing to safe his friend.
